!        Rayleigh scattering for each sub-band in bands1, visible region
!        taur is the optical depth rayleigh scattering for a given layer
!        for uvc (35700 - 50000 cm^-1), since the optical depth of o3 and
!        o2 are very large, rayleigh scattering effect is neglected, it
!        is shown even for 10% o3 amount of the standard atmo, the
!        rayleigh scattering for uvc still can be neglected.
!        For par and uva, since their spectral ranges are very wide, small
!        errors could occur for large zenith angle, slightly adjustment
!        is needed, this does mean the rayleigh optical depth is related
!        solar zenith angle for multiple scattering process in swtran.
!
!Arguments
!
! taur   rayleigh optical depth
! dp     air mass path for a model layer (explained in raddriv).
! rmu3   a factor of solar zenith angle, given in raddriv
